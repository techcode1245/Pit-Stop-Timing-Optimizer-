# 🏁 Pit Stop Timing Optimizer 🔧
#
# 1. Ask the user for the total race time in seconds.
# 2. Ask how many pit stops were made.
# 3. Ask for the average pit stop duration (in seconds).
#
# Then:
# - Calculate the total pit stop time.
# - Calculate the percentage of the race spent in the pits.
# - Round the percentage to 2 decimal places.
#
# Finally, print all of the following:
# - Total pit stop time in seconds
# - Percentage of race time spent in pits
# - A final message if pit time > 5% of the race: "You need a new pit crew. 🛠️"


total_race_time = int(input("Total Race time (in seconds): "))
pit_stops_made = int(input("How many Pit stops were made?: "))
avg_stop_dt = int(input("Average pit stop duration (in seconds): "))


total_pit_time = avg_stop_dt * pit_stops_made
pit_percent= round(total_pit_time / total_race_time * 100 , 2)

if pit_percent > 5:
    print("you need a new pit crew")
else:
    print("You are fine for now. ")
